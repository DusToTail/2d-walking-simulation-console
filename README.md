# Description
2D WALKING SIMULATION by Duong Trung Tin
Brief Desciption
This application is an attempt to simulate a 2D Platform game on console platform.
It was intended to be real-time game, by using multitasking, assigning systems into their own thread.
However, due to unability to import a certain library that allows more control over keyboard input and the difficulty to synchronize threads well, the design was changed to a turn-based game
The Console Screen is 150 wide and 40 high. With each character-wide cell represents a space to be used for illustrating objects such as player and obstacles.

Further Description can be found when excuting the application.
